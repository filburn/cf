# This is my personal website

This website was built using SvelteKit.

## Developing

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Add an `-- --open` flag to open a new browser tab automatically.


## Building

To create a production version for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> An [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) may be needed to deploy to the target environment.
