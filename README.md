# This is my personal website

This website was built using SvelteKit.

## Developing

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Add an `-- --open` flag to open a new browser tab automatically.


## Building

To create a production version for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> An [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) may be needed to deploy to the target environment.

## Deploying

This site uses `adapter-static` to build a static website. The project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages by using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push a commit from the current local repository to the `gh-pages` branch and kick off a deployment.
